# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello, I am Md Hasan, a **Data Scientist** deeply passionate about **Generative AI (GenAI)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Computer Vision**, and **MLOps**.


Currently, I am pursuing my MSc in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU)**, NÃ¼rnberg, Germany. I am also pursuing my **Master's thesis** on *A multimodal approach for automatic generation of radiology reports using chest X-ray images* by FAU research funding, which combines my interests in AI and healthcare applications. 


Alongside my academic pursuits, I am employed as a **Data Scientist (working student)** at **Innomotics GmbH**, a Siemens business, where I focus on developing advanced RAG applications using LLMs. Prior to this, I worked as a **Data Analytics (working student)** at **BMW Group**, where I developed ETL workflows, predictive analysis models, and data-driven solutions to improve internal business processes.


You can learn more about my work and projects on my **Publications & Projects** page, or feel free to reach out to me via **[contact information](mailto:mdhasan.nsu@gmail.com)**.
