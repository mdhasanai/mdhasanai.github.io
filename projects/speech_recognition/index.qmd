This project implements a **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)** model for **Bangla speech recognition** using **PyTorch**. The project focuses on sequence-to-sequence tasks with utilities for data loading, preprocessing, training, and validation. This project aims to build an efficient speech recognition system for the Bangla language.

## Key Features:
- **Seq2Seq Model**: A sequence-to-sequence deep learning model is used to transcribe Bangla speech to text.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: The entire model is built using the **PyTorch** framework.
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: The project includes utilities for loading, preprocessing, and preparing the speech dataset.
- **Training and Validation**: Scripts are provided for training and validating the model.

## Technologies and Dependencies:
- **Python 3.7**
- **PyTorch**
- **NumPy**
- **Librosa**: For audio processing.
