Here are some of my recent publications:

## 1. **MHASAN**: Multi-head Angular Self-Attention Network for Spoof Detection
   - <span class="authors">Md Hasan, et al.</span>
   - <span class="journal">Published in [ICPR], 2022</span>
   - <span class="description">This paper presents a novel multi-head angular self-attention network designed to improve spoof detection in biometric systems. The proposed method enhances feature extraction capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance in face anti-spoofing tasks.</span>

## 2. **Bi-FPNFAS**: Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network for Pixel-wise Face Anti-Spoofing Leveraging Fourier Spectra
   - <span class="authors">Md Hasan, et al.</span>
   - <span class="journal">Published in [Sensors], 2021</span>
   - <span class="description">This work introduces a bi-directional feature pyramid network (Bi-FPN) that leverages Fourier spectra for pixel-wise face anti-spoofing. By focusing on both high- and low-level features, the network improves robustness against various spoofing attacks.</span>

## 3. **Bangla Part of Speech Tagging Using Contextual Embeddings and Oversampling Techniques**
   - <span class="authors">Md Hasan, et al.</span>
   - <span class="journal">Published in [FTC], 2021</span>
   - <span class="description">This paper addresses the challenge of Bangla part-of-speech tagging using contextual embeddings and oversampling techniques to handle imbalanced data. The model significantly improves the accuracy of POS tagging for Bangla, a low-resource language.</span>
