    "text": "Welcome to My Portfolio\nHello, I am Md Hasan, a Data Scientist deeply passionate about Generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision, and MLOps.\nCurrently, I am pursuing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Nürnberg, Germany. I am also pursuing my Master’s thesis on A multimodal approach for automatic generation of radiology reports using chest X-ray images by FAU research funding, which combines my interests in AI and healthcare applications.\nAlongside my academic pursuits, I am employed as a Data Scientist (working student) at Innomotics GmbH, a Siemens business, where I focus on developing advanced RAG applications using LLMs. Prior to this, I worked as a Data Analytics (working student) at BMW Group, where I developed ETL workflows, predictive analysis models, and data-driven solutions to improve internal business processes.\nYou can learn more about my work and projects on my Publications & Projects page, or feel free to reach out to me via contact information."

    "text": "In this data science project, I have analyzed the availability and usage patterns of electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities in Germany as part of my course project. By leveraging Python for data manipulation, SQL for database management, and machine learning techniques for predictive analysis. This project offers deep insights into the current state of EV charging infrastructure. The analysis is powered by various libraries, including Pandas for data wrangling, Plotly for interactive visualizations, Seaborn and Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and SQLAlchemy for database interactions."
